v2.0.3
    - PATCH
        • Allowed add-on to be installed directly from a git clone.

v2.0.2
    - PATCH
        • Fixed driver emboss.

v2.0.1
    - PATCH
        • Fixed SystemError when using "New Shape From Mix".

v2.0.0
    - MAJOR
        • The add-on now utilizes a robust tree hierarchy internally, so folders can be multi-selected.
        • Extended the "Copy Shape Key" operator to copy drivers and, optionally, override specific properties.
        • The add-on has been organized into multiple Python modules under the `shape_keys_plus` package.
        • The add-on has been fully translated to Japanese.
            To add/modify translations, see the Japanese implementation in `shape_keys_plus/core/translations.py`.

    - MINOR
        • The "Mirror Shape Key" operator has been replaced with one that's compatible with folders and multi-selection.
        • To save a bit of horizontal space, the sidebar's context menus and operator buttons have been merged.
            To access a context menu, click and hold (or drag) the respective operator button.
        • The debug operator "Mutate Folder" is now available via search menu.
        • The normal shape key icon is now hidden to make folders easier to see,
            but can be changed back to any icon in the add-on preferences.
        • Folders icons explicitly set to the default pair will now be updated automatically.
        • Moved the settings for the default folder icon to the add-on preferences,
            so they will persist between projects.

    - PATCH
        • Fixed the Rotation Mode property being reset upon driver variable sorting operations.
        • Fixed inability to retain driver variable data when DriverTarget.id is set to a non-Object.
        • To further speed up shape key operations, the object will be temporarily hidden. This allows all
            operations to be executed in bulk before updating the mesh, meaning performance issues are no
            longer proportional to how many shape keys you have, but rather how long it takes to hide/unhide the object.
            This can be further rectified on the user's end by hiding intense modifiers such as Subdivision.

v1.3.5
    - PATCH
        • Added the Rotation Mode property to rotation-based Transform Channel drivers.
        • Removed unused Transform Type/Space properties from Rotational Difference drivers.

v1.3.4
    - PATCH
	    • Fixed pinning issue; replaced all `context.active_object` with `context.object`
	        so that the add-on retains its references to the pinned object while another object is active.

v1.3.3
    - PATCH
        • To speed up the operation, moving a shape key will now temporarily disable all of the object's modifiers.
        • Reverted the shape key mute icon from a checkbox back to an eye,
            since this add-on already uses the checkbox for multi-selection.

v1.3.2
    - PATCH
	    • Removed extra, unused parameter from the UIList's `draw_filter()` method.

v1.3.1
    - PATCH
	    • Updated `user_preferences` references to `preferences`.

v1.3.0
    - MINOR
        • Initial update for compatibility with Blender's 2.80 Beta.
        • Removed now-obsolete "Custom Property from Shape Key" operator and dedicated panel.

	- PATCH
        • Minor UI adjustments.
        • Minor code cleanup.

v1.2.0
    - MINOR

        • Added Tool Shelf >> Create >> Shape Keys+ panel to contain the "Custom Property from Shape Key" operator.

	- PATCH
	    • Minor UI adjustments.

    - PATCH
        • Fixed typo from v1.1.1 patch.
