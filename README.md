# Shape Keys+

A free [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) add-on that grants ***Shape Keys+,*** a plus-size panel containing extra features for creating, sorting, viewing, and driving shape keys.

Automatically hides the default ***Shape Keys*** panel, which can be enabled again via the add-on's preferences. ***Shape Keys+*** was made to help with managing hundreds of shape keys on a fully rigged character. It focuses on saving time and decreasing the number of clicks needed for common operations such as moving or copying shape keys.

Click-holding or click-dragging on one of the **Add** / **Copy** / **Remove** sidebar buttons will open its respective specials menu, containing extra operations related to the respective button.

# Features

- **Shape Key Placement**
> Control where shape keys are automatically placed after specific operations.

- **Copy Shape Key**
> Copy the shape key, its driver, and all or some of its properties. Capable of copying and mirroring at the same time.

- **Multi-Selection**
> Perform basic operations on multiple shape keys and folders at once. Compatible with “New Shape From Mix” as it creates a new shape out of a mix of the selected shape keys. Features compatible with multi-selection become exposed when at least one shape key or folder is selected.
